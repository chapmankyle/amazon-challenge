### *rising_numbers*
A rising number is a positive decimal integer of which no digit is smaller than a digit to its left. 

The numbers `1234` and `455567778` are both rising numbers, while `1232` and `17880` are not.

The sum of rising numbers less than `10^3` is `60885`. 

What is the sum of rising numbers less than `10^1000,000,000`?

### *super_cranky_integers*
The integer `351` has the property that `3 x 51 = 153`, the digit-reverse of `351`. 

The same is true for `425322`, since `42 x 5322 = 223524`, and also for `57982563`, since `579825 x 63 = 36528975`.

Positive integers larger than `9` which have this property when written in decimal are called cranky.

The sum of all cranky integers smaller than `10^6` is `1778723`. 

What is the sum of all cranky integers smaller than `10^14`?
